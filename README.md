The task was written in angular 14.
When you first load the app, you'll see two buttons: "Rectangle" and "Triangle". Clicking on either button will take you to a form where you can enter the width and height of the shape.

If you choose "Rectangle", the app will calculate the area of the rectangle wether its scope and display it on the page.

If you choose "Triangle", you'll be presented with two different options for printing the triangle- its scope/area or printing the shape itself. Once you've selected the options you want, you can click the "Print" button to display the triangle on the page.

After the shape has been calculated or printed, the app will automatically navigate back to the home page.
